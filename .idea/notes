When to Use Each Model

| Model | Best For | Optimizer | Why That Optimizer |
|-------|----------|-----------|-------------------|
| Linear Regression | Linear relationships, interpretable results | OLS | Fast, exact, mathematically optimal |
| Ridge Regression | High-dimensional data, correlated features | L2 regularization | Prevents overfitting, handles multicollinearity |
| Decision Trees | Non-linear relationships, categorical features | Greedy algorithm | Simple, fast, captures complex patterns |
| Random Forest | Complex data, noisy data, robust predictions | Bagging | Reduces overfitting, averages multiple models |

What is an Optimizer?

An optimizer is an algorithm that finds the minimum of a function (the objective/loss function). 
In machine learning, this means finding the best parameters for your model.
